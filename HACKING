= Coding style =

This project uses mostly the same file naming and coding style like
librevenge and the rest of Fridrich's libraries. Please run

    astyle --options=astyle.options \*.cpp \*.h

before committing.


Alternatively, set hooks for your git repository

    git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks

to run astyle on every commit.
