= Coding style =

This project uses mostly the same file naming and coding style like
librevenge and the rest of Fridrich's libraries. Please run

    astyle --options=astyle.options \*.cpp \*.h

before committing.


Alternatively, set hooks for your git repository

    git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks

to run astyle on every commit.


= Activate all compiler warnings =

In order to compile the library with all warnings active, create a meson build directory
with an additional argument in the following way:

```
meson build -Dwparanoic=true
ninja -C build
```

To compile the library as debug version configure your build directory in the following way:

```
meson build -Ddebug=true
```
